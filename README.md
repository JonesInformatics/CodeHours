# CodeHours
Repository to track the number hours I have spent writing code, and my progress to meet milestones on the way to my final goal. 

"The first significant payout before any job offers was about three years 
 after I started and after writing code for three or four thousand hours
 with no financial return. Not a very safe career path but it worked out"
